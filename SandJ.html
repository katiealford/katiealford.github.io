				<h1>Colliers International</h1>
			</div>
			<div id="sandjadvertising" class="paragraph">My time working in commercial real estate with industry experts, has been a significant period of growth. To be able to learn marketing practices and contribute new ideas in an environment where enterprising, passionate and creative people come to make a difference has been powerful. At Colliers, I not only get to create marketing pieces that are seen world-wide, but I also get to be a part of a vast network of designers who are genuinely supportive and inspirational.<br>
				<br>
			My marketing skills have been put to the test working for the best of the best. The projects involved with selling and leasing buildings/land in a booming area such as the San Fracisco Bay Area's East Bay demand top-notch, forward-thinking designs. I, along with my fellow designers, continually put forward excellent work, while keeping a positive attitude, to ensure only the best results for the brokers. <br>

				<h1>S &amp; J Advertising</h1>
			</div>
			<div id="sandjadvertising" class="paragraph">At S &amp; J Advertising I worked directly with clients to create compelling stories that embrace their products. I implemented social media platforms company-wide. In addition, I managed multiple customer accounts spanning diverse industries. Conducting all aspects of  advertising campaigns (design, copywriting, and editing) has resulted in an in depth understanding of successful marketing strategies, and an overall appreciation for the industry. I've also had to pleasure of being able to contribute to community articles and being responsible for diverse layouts across four different monthly publications.
