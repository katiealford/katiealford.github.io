			<div id="sandjadvertising" class="paragraph"> The Studio Art Bachelor's Degree at Humboldt State University requires that the student expand beyond their media of focus, and therefore leaping beyond one's comfort zone. For me, this proved not only extremely beneficial as an artist, but gratifyingly life-changing. I was introduced to graphic design in all its glory. I was &mdash; and continue to be &mdash; hooked. 
			<br>
			<br>
			I wanted more. So after my assignments ended, I was struck with a summer of no computer labs to hibernate in. This, combined with limited graphic design courses offered at HSU, led me to seek outside resources. I became the new Graphic Design Intern for Green Wheels, a non-profit organization that works for a healthier community, economy and environment, advocating for balanced and sustainable transportation on the North Coast. Not only did I design public service announcements and event media, but was also immersed into the local community becoming directly involved with politics as they pertained to alternative transportation projects.<br>
			<br>
			I had an insanely enjoyable time hanging out with the Green Wheels crew for almost two years, as I continued school and worked in a coffee shop during nights and weekends, (because as you may have guessed, an internship at a NPO doesn't exactly weigh your wallet down). So much so, that I was elated when offered a position at their parent NPO, the Northcoast Environmental Center.
