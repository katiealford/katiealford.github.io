		<h2 class="description">Hi! I'm Katie, a Silicon Valley-bred, Oakland-based graphic designer and painter. I enjoy living amidst my own brand of organized chaos, which I believe lends itself to my keen eye for design. An environmentalist at heart, I grew up acutely aware of both my surroundings and the people that inhabited those spaces, developing into an interest in the human psyche. I was rewarded, in turn, with the ability to consider different perspectives, which manifested itself in ever-evolving, more susceptible art. Wanting to apply this passion and understanding, I began creating meaningful graphics and writing soulful copy for an environmental non-profit, and thus began my love for design with a purpose.
		<br>
		<br>
		As design has evolved, so have I. Learning front-end web development to further build on my skills has been a difficult but rewarding journey thus far. I love the idea of using the web's full potential to complete challenges, whether for myself or others. When I'm not designing, I can be spotted rock climbing, getting my namaste on, being your dog's new best friend, devouring Sophia Amoruso's '#GIRLBOSS' for the 'nth time, or brewing the perfect (really!) cup of pour-over coffee.
